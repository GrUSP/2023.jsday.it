        talk_description: "Astro, a latest generation JavaScript framework, has recently released version 2.0, and since the first version it has been a huge success thanks to its simplicity, performance and the island architecture, a technique that use partial hydration to use several UI frameworks and libraries in the same view, such as React, Vue, Svelte and many others. <br />
  Astro uses pre-rendering techniques such as SSG (Static Site Generation) and SSR (Server Side Rendering) and has the main objective of speeding up the display of content: for this reason it is the ideal tool for creating landing pages, blogs and Web pages that require high search engine scores and high performance.<br />
  In this session I'll describe how Astro work and we will analyze the necessary steps to install, configure and create landing pages and blogs by using SSG, SSR, markdown and the island architecture."

        talk_title: "Powering up Micro-frontends at the Edge!"
        talk_description: "Today's digital landscape has become a fast-paced environment where businesses constantly look for ways to increase efficiency, reduce latency, and improve user experience. Micro-frontends offer a new approach to front-end development, addressing these challenges by breaking down monolithic front-ends applications into smaller, independent, and reusable components, making them easier to deploy, manage, and scale. As part of this talk, we will explore micro-frontends and how to gradually incorporate the architecture into existing codebases using Cloudflare Workers. It can be time-consuming to completely migrate a legacy application using the micro-frontends approach, so we'll explore ways to effectively and efficiently adopt and implement micro-frontends. This talk will give attendees a strong foundation for creating micro-frontends powered by Cloudflare Workers to enable them to enhance their applications leading to better user experience and increased performance."

          talk_description: "We, as streaming service users, consume daily movies and media that are easily accessible and can be enjoyed mostly on every device and any browser. <br />
            However, this is not always the case. There are still many industries that deal with data that initially have extensions not supported by browsers and thus they are not immediately available for visualization and usage. <br />
            The problem is certainly very common in HealthCare companies that have to deal with data coming from Medical Devices (ultrasound scan, CT scan…), and that come next handled, visualized and used in Web Applications to provide Digital Services or for Artificial Intelligence implementations. These companies face the problem of converting in real time a large amount of data, and they need fast, reliable and scalable solutions.
<br /> During this talk, I’ll show you how to make large amounts of media files available in browsers and web applications, by creating a service with Typescript, NodeJS, and fluent-ffmpeg, in a serverless application to ensure availability and scalability."

          <br />CommonJS and ESM have different features, and they are not fully compatible with each other: should existing libraries migrate to ESM? Should they keep using ESM forever? Are JavaScript tools ready for native ESM?
<br />
Babel is one of the most used packages on npm, and we have been slowly working to move away from CommonJS. What obstacles have we found? How did we overcome them? What have we learned in the process? How do we ensure a smooth transition for our users?a"

        talk_title: "Designing and building resilient backend APIs in the cloud"
        talk_description: "An application is resilient when it has the ability to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate issues, such as misconfigurations or transient network issues. Since resiliency is key for an optimal customer experience, building highly resilient workloads in the cloud is a goal for many businesses, from startups to enterprises. If you're a developer, tech lead, or architect wondering what can you do to foster resiliency best practices within your team or organisation, this is the right talk for you. Through a mix of theory, code examples and a demo, you will learn advanced patterns and design principles you should consider at every stage of the software lifecycle."

        talk_title: "Everything's better with friends"
        talk_description: "Software is meant to be alive, interactive, and experience shared best with your friends and colleagues. Building applications like these have always been difficult for mere mortals - they're expensive, hard to build and maintain, and never quite right ...until now. Over the last few years, changes in the ecosystem and platform capabilities have made the building blocks for building real-time collaborative applications much more accessible and within the reach of developers like you and me. I'd like to show you some of the work I've been doing in this area, as well as participate in a demo built on this technology. "

        talk_title: "Implementing web3 via APIs is still decentralized?"
        talk_description: "When we talk about decentralized applications we mean an application where control and decision-making is transferred to a distributed network.
Sometimes we find this formula: a user that interacts with the dApp frontend — either web or mobile — which then interacts with the backend APIs. The backend, then, on request interacts with the smart contract(s) or blockchain through public nodes.
Is this the right way to build a decentralized application or we are missing something?
Let’s dive into it!"
